\section*{Our Application}
We are creating an interactive web app to help users gain access to crime data in their neighborhood. This could be especially useful for people who plan to assess how safe a neighborhood is before moving into a new place, while walking home at odd times or people who are just curious about this kind of data. We are presently experimenting with a number of different cities and data sets. Our primary data sets are taken from the Toronto Police Open Data Portal (\url{https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/open-data}). Another batch of data sets we are looking at come from the New York Open Data (\url{https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYC-crime/qb7u-rbmr}). 
\section*{Platform and Tech stack}
Our interface will consist of an interactive web-app. We will be using GCP to host our database and run a MySQL instance. This setup is ideal and efficient for building a web app such as ours. GCP and MySQL are modern, scalable, efficient and flexible. We will be using Node.js for our back-end and to interact with the database. Members of our group have experience with Node.js which gives us an excellent basis for our project.
