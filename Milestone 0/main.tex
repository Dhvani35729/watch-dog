\section{Platform and Tech stack}

\begin{itemize}


    \item  We are planning on making an interactive web-app. 

    \item We will use Google cloud platform to host our database and run a MySQL instance. This setup is ideal and most efficient while building a web app such as ours. GCP and MySQL is scalable, efficient and easy to work with.

    \item We are considering using Django/Node.js (with permission from the instructor) for our back-end and to interact with the database.
